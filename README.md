If you need the source code let me know.

I have only telegram and if paid I use only crypto to protect myself as a payment.
I code 15h per day different things personal and also company type.
I live in Austria so please respect my timezone when you message on Telegram..

Please do not try to call me I do not turn my phone off when I sleep so it will ring and wake me up and I will get stressed and I will ban you.

Please use only ssl google passed proxies, if you have budget please buy premium socks5 type proxies example: proxy.am
If not use any residential socks5 but NOT changed IP on request use sticky proxies for at least 15min.

<b>Telegram:</b> https://t.me/dev_bot_official

<b>HOW DOES IT WORKS?</b>
1. Music YouTube
2. Live Stream (need cookies btw)
3. Offline views
4. MultiVideo URL
5. Multi threads
6. Autoscrape free proxies (but ratio is like 35% valid views still good it is free)
7. Auto loop
8. Different fingerprint from referal, search, embed etc...

Enjoy.

<b>=>PLEASE DO NOT COME TO TELEGRAM and EXPECT to get this for FREE! Your parents doesn"t work for free either me too.</b><br>
<b>=>PLEASE DO NOT SAY it is expensive! You can create your own tool and GIVE it for 20 bucks but not me!</b><br><br>

<b>PLEASE USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK since YouTube do NOT ALLOW API BOTS I only made it because I love coding.</b>
